# Define dispatch-default Ralph execution contract

## Task
Define and codify dispatch-mode defaults and fallback flags for Ralph execution.

## Context
The approved plan makes `--dispatch` the default and keeps a fallback path via `--no-interactive-shell`.
This needs a clear contract for `tf ralph run/start` argument behavior and backward compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `--dispatch` is defaulted for `tf ralph run` and `tf ralph start`.
- [ ] `--no-interactive-shell` cleanly routes to legacy subprocess backend.
- [ ] Help/usage text reflects the new default and fallback.

## Constraints
- Preserve existing command compatibility and safety semantics.

## Notes
