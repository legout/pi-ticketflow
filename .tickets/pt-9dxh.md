# Implement full progress.md updates for /ralph-loop

Write structured progress updates to .tf/ralph/progress.md matching Ralph conventions: counters, current state, per-ticket outcomes, and timestamps.

## Acceptance Criteria

progress.md is updated on launch/completion/failure; counters are correct; terminal state written on completion; format remains compatible with tf ralph status expectations.
