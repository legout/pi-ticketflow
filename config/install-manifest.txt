# TF Project Bundle Install Manifest
#
# Used by: `tf init` and `tf sync` to ensure TF workflow assets are installed
# into a project.
#
# Routing (project):
# - agents/*, skills/*, prompts/*  → <project>/.pi/
# - config/*, scripts/*           → <project>/.tf/
#
# Note:
# - The `tf` CLI shim is installed globally via `tf install` (or install.sh --global).
# - MCP/web-search config and Pi extensions are set up globally via `tf setup` / `tf login`.
