# Implementation: ptw-c4ei

## Summary
Created a `CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root following the Keep a Changelog format with SemVer guidance.

## Files Changed
- `CHANGELOG.md` - New file with:
  - Keep a Changelog format guidance (link to keepachangelog.com)
  - SemVer guidance (link to semver.org)
  - [Unreleased] section for upcoming changes
  - [0.1.0] initial release section with comprehensive feature list
  - GitHub comparison links for version tracking

## Key Decisions
- Used Keep a Changelog v1.1.0 as the reference format
- Used SemVer v2.0.0 as the versioning standard
- Created meaningful initial content for version 0.1.0 based on the README and project structure
- Included GitHub-style comparison links (template format) for future versioning
- Used date format YYYY-MM-DD as per Keep a Changelog specification

## Tests Run
- Verified CHANGELOG.md renders correctly as Markdown
- No code changes required, so no unit tests needed

## Verification
1. Check that `CHANGELOG.md` exists at repo root
2. Verify it contains Keep a Changelog reference and SemVer reference
3. Verify it has Unreleased and 0.1.0 sections
