# Review: pt-m54d

## Overall Assessment
The specification clearly captures the desired Ralph queue-state semantics, output formats, and backwards-compatibility concerns, which should make downstream implementation tasks straightforward to execute. Invariant definitions and example output strings align well with existing progress/logging behaviors, so the proposal integrates cleanly with the current CLI experience.

## Critical (must fix)
- No issues found

## Major (should fix)

## Minor (nice to fix)

## Warnings (follow-up ticket)

## Suggestions (follow-up ticket)

## Positive Notes
- `.tf/knowledge/tickets/pt-m54d/implementation.md` provides a detailed invariant table, queue-state helper API, and integration guidance, giving downstream engineers a solid blueprint for pt-oa8n/pt-ussr/pt-ri6k.
