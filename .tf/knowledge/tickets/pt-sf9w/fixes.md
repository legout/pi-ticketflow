# Fixes: pt-sf9w

## Analysis
This was a verification-only task. The Critical and Major issues relate to documentation gaps and ticket state updates rather than code fixes.

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ Major: Acceptance Criteria Checkboxes
Updated the ticket via `tk edit` to check off completed acceptance criteria.

### ❌ Critical: README.md Documentation
**Not addressed in this ticket** - Documentation is the responsibility of blocking ticket pt-ls9y "Document web mode: `textual serve` for `tf ui`". Adding docs here would duplicate work.

### ❌ Major: docs/ folder Documentation  
**Not addressed in this ticket** - Same as above, covered by pt-ls9y.

### ❌ Minor: Comment in tf_cli/ui.py
**Not addressed** - The `__main__` block is self-explanatory; adding comments for this would be noise.

### ❌ Warnings/Suggestions
**Not addressed** - These are enhancement ideas for follow-up tickets.

## Files Changed
- None (verification-only task)

## Note
The blocking ticket pt-ls9y is specifically for documentation. This ticket (pt-sf9w) was constrained to verification + recording findings, per its Acceptance Criteria: "Keep this as verification + notes; no feature work unless required for basic function."
