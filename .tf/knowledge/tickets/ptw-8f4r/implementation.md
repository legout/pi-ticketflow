# Implementation: ptw-8f4r

## Summary
Added a `--no-links` usage example to the tf-backlog prompt's Examples section.

## Files Changed
- `prompts/tf-backlog.md` - Added `/tf-backlog seed-myfeature --no-links` example

## Key Decisions
- Placed the new example between the `--no-component-tags` example and the combined flags example
- Used `seed-myfeature` as the topic name to match the pattern of other seed examples
- Kept the example simple (single flag) for clarity as requested

## Verification
- Verified the example follows the existing format
- Confirmed the `--no-links` option is documented in the Options section above
