# seed-add-more-logging-to-ralph-loop

Improve observability of the Ralph loop when executed via `tk ralph start` / `tk ralph run` by adding more structured, actionable logging. The goal is to make it easier to understand what Ralph is doing, why it made a decision, and where it failed without having to re-run with a debugger.
