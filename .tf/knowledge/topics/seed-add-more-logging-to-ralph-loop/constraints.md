# Constraints

- Logging must not leak secrets (tokens, API keys, private prompts) into console output.
- Default mode should be concise; verbose/debug mode can be chatty.
- Logs should be stable and greppable (consistent prefixes/fields).
- MVP should be implementable in 1–2 hours (focus on the highest-value log points).
