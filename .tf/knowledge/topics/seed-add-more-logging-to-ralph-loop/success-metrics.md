# Success Metrics

- Faster diagnosis: a failed Ralph run can be understood from logs without re-running.
- Clear progress: you can tell which ticket + phase Ralph is currently executing.
- Actionable errors: logs point to artifact directories and the failing tool/command.
- Low noise: default output remains readable; verbose mode provides deeper detail.
