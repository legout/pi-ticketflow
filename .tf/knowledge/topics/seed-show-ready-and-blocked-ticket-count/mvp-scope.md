# MVP Scope

## In Scope (MVP)

- Update the Ralph progress display to show **ready** and **blocked** counts.
- In normal logging mode, print ready/blocked counts when:
  - a ticket starts processing
  - a ticket finishes processing (success or failure)
- Add/adjust tests (unit tests or snapshot tests) covering the new formatting.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Full-screen TUI dashboard.
- Historical metrics collection / persisted run summaries.
- Highly granular per-step or per-tool progress metrics.
