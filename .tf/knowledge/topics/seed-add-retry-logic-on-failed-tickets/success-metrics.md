# Success Metrics

- Reduced thrashing: the same ticket is not reprocessed endlessly without progress.
- Faster convergence: quality-gate blocked tickets close successfully in fewer iterations.
- Better reliability: retries use stronger models when necessary, improving fix success rate.
- Clear diagnostics: artifacts/logs explain why the ticket is still open and what to do next.
