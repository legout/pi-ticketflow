# Constraints

- Must be conservative: avoid changing priorities unless confident and/or user confirms.
- Default mode should be **dry-run**.
- Should not modify closed/archived tickets unless explicitly requested.
- Must align with existing Ticketflow priority semantics (including any numeric mapping).
- Keep MVP small (1–2 hours of work) with minimal configuration.
