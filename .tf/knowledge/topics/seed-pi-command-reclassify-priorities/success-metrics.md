# Success Metrics

- Triage time reduced: reclassifying a batch of tickets takes minutes, not hours.
- Priority consistency: fewer “why is this P1?” discussions; rubric becomes shared language.
- Adoption: command is used regularly during backlog grooming.
- Safety: zero unintended priority changes (dry-run default + explicit apply).
- Traceability: each change is explainable and optionally recorded.
