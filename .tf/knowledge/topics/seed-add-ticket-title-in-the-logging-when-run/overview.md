# seed-add-ticket-title-in-the-logging-when-run

Improve verbose logging in `tf ralph` so that when `--verbose` is enabled, log lines include the **ticket title** alongside the ticket ID. This makes it easier to follow progress across multiple tickets and correlate actions with the work being done.
