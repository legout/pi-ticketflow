# seed-add-ralph-loop-background-interactive

Add a Ralph execution mode that runs each ticket implementation in a fresh **background interactive shell** (`pi /tf ... --auto`), while still allowing users to attach and observe live progress when desired. The goal is to keep autonomous throughput, guarantee fresh context per ticket, and enable safe parallel execution.
