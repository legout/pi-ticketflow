Done. I completed the review phase for `abc-123` and wrote consolidated output to:
`.tf/knowledge/tickets/abc-123/review.md`

Summary:
- Loaded workflow config and ticket context (`tk show abc-123`)
- Used reviewers configured in `.tf/config/settings.json`
- Updated reviewer artifacts:
  - `.tf/knowledge/tickets/abc-123/review-general.md`
  - `.tf/knowledge/tickets/abc-123/review-spec.md`
  - `.tf/knowledge/tickets/abc-123/review-second.md`
- Merged into consolidated review:
  - `.tf/knowledge/tickets/abc-123/review.md`

Merged review counts:
- Critical: 0
- Major: 0
- Minor: 0
- Warnings: 0
- Suggestions: 1

Key note:
- Suggestion to add an explicit CLI BrokenPipeError test in `tests/test_demo_hello.py`.
