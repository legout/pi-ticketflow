# Research: abc-123

## Status
Research completed. No additional external research was performed.

## Rationale
- Ticket is a straightforward demo task for creating a hello-world utility
- Implementation is internal to the project with no external dependencies
- Standard Python patterns and project conventions are well-established
- Existing research from knowledge base is sufficient

## Context Reviewed
- `tk show abc-123` - Ticket requirements (hello-world utility with name parameter, docstring, tests)
- `.tf/knowledge/tickets/abc-123/research.md` - Existing research artifact
- Project Python conventions (from __future__ imports, type hints, docstrings)
- Demo module structure in `demo/` directory

## Sources
- (none - internal implementation task)
