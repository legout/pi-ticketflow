## Workflow Complete: pt-qmor ✅

**Ticket Status**: Closed

**Summary**: This was a verification task to ensure unit tests exist for timestamped Ralph progress output. Upon investigation, comprehensive tests were already in place from the previous implementation ticket (pt-d68t).

### Acceptance Criteria Verified

| Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Tests cover TTY and non-TTY paths | ✅ | `TestProgressDisplayTTY` (3 tests) + `TestProgressDisplayNonTTY` (7 tests) |
| Timestamp prefix assertions | ✅ | Pattern `r"\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}"` used in 10+ assertions |
| pytest passes | ✅ | 22/22 tests pass |

### Test Execution
```
$ python -m pytest tests/test_progress_display.py -v
============================== 22 passed in 0.07s ==============================
```

### Artifacts Created
- `.tf/knowledge/tickets/pt-qmor/implementation.md` - Implementation documentation
- `.tf/knowledge/tickets/pt-qmor/review.md` - Review summary (0 issues)
- `.tf/knowledge/tickets/pt-qmor/fixes.md` - No fixes needed
- `.tf/knowledge/tickets/pt-qmor/close-summary.md` - Final summary
