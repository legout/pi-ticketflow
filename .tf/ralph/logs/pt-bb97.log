## ✅ Ticket pt-bb97 Complete

### Summary

Successfully implemented the **Ready/Blocked board classification logic** and comprehensive unit tests for the Ticketflow Kanban TUI.

### What Was Implemented

**`tf_cli/board_classifier.py`** - Core classification module with:
- `BoardColumn` enum (ready, blocked, in_progress, closed)
- `ClassifiedTicket` wrapper with blocking dependency tracking
- `BoardClassifier` with dependency graph resolution
- `BoardView` immutable snapshot with filtering/search
- `classify_tickets()` convenience function

**`tests/test_board_classifier.py`** - 31 comprehensive tests covering:
- Classification rules for all 4 columns
- Dependency graph scenarios (linear, diamond, complex)
- BoardView operations (filter, search, counts)
- Edge cases (circular deps, missing deps, self-referential)
- Case-insensitive status handling

### Classification Rules (from plan)

| Column | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Closed** | `status == "closed"` (regardless of dependencies) |
| **In Progress** | `status == "in_progress"` AND all deps closed |
| **Blocked** | `status in {open, in_progress}` AND any dep not closed |
| **Ready** | `status == "open"` AND all deps closed |

### Review & Fixes

- **3 reviewers** found: 0 Critical, 0 Major, 5 Minor issues
