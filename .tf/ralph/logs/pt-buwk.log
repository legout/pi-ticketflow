## Summary

**Ticket:** pt-buwk - Add regression test/smoke coverage for ralph pi invocation args

**Status:** CLOSED

**Commit:** `e05c07e pt-buwk: Add regression test for ralph pi invocation args`

### Implementation
Created `tests/test_ralph_pi_invocation.py` with 3 test cases:

1. **`test_ralph_run_pi_invocation_no_session_with_session_dir`** - Verifies `tf ralph run` does not include `--session` even when session_dir is configured
2. **`test_ralph_start_pi_invocation_no_session_with_session_dir`** - Verifies `tf ralph start` does not include `--session`
3. **`test_pi_command_starts_with_pi_dash_p`** - Verifies basic command structure

### Key Points
- Tests use mocking to avoid requiring actual Pi execution (stable, no flakiness)
- The first test **currently FAILS** as expected - this is intentional since pt-ihfv (which removes `--session` forwarding) hasn't been implemented yet
- Once pt-ihfv is complete, the tests will pass, serving as regression protection
- All existing tests continue to pass

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- [x] Test fails if `--session` appears in the constructed `pi` argv for start/run
- [x] Test is stable and does not require actually running Pi (mock subprocess/command builder)
- [x] `pytest` passes locally (except for expected failure until pt-ihfv)
